The latter takes precedence over the first.\n IMPORTANT: ERC-2981 only specifies a way to signal royalty information and does not enforce its payment. See\n https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981#optional-royalty-payments[Rationale] in the EIP. Marketplaces are expected to\n voluntarily pay royalties together with sales, but note that this standard is not yet widely supported.\n _Available since v4.5._"

See\n https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981#optional-royalty-payments[Rationale] in the EIP. Marketplaces are expected to\n voluntarily pay royalties together with sales, but note that this standard is not yet widely supported.\n _Available since v4.5._"
